Welcome back to this series about digits recognition! Today, we're entering the difficult-but-rewarding part of the process. We'll turn our randomly-generated neural network into a trained expert of digits recognition.

## How do we teach a neural network?
### Finding the right weights and biases

### Gradient descend *(the maths are back)*

### Computing the gradient with backpropagation

### Epochs, batches, etc.

## Coding it all
### The structure

### The main function: `train`

### Updating weights and biases with `learn`

### The final piece: `backpropagation`
#### Outline

#### Forward pass

#### Backward pass


## Reward time
### Testing on a few images

### What's left to do
