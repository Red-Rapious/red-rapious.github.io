While looking for interesting topics for my TIPE (see above), I came across [this amazing tutorial series](https://lorenabarba.com/blog/cfd-python-12-steps-to-navier-stokes/) on Computational Fluid Dynamics. While following the course, I decided to implement an animated version of the simulation, using `Matplotlib`.
