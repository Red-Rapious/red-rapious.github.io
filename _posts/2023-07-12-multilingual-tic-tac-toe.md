![TIC TAC TOE](../assets/projects/tic-tac-toe.png)

One of the very first programs I wrote entirely myself was a Tic-Tac-Toe that I coded in `C`, back when I was 11. I still think that a Tic-Tac-Toe is a great mini-project to learn any programming language, so I decided to create this repository, with the same CLI program, written in various languages.

I plan to add more languages in the future, but the languages implemented right now are `C`, `Python`, and `Rust`.
