## About
My goal is to create a perfect Connect Four bot, capable of predicting the outcome of a game in a reasonable computing time. The solvers are based on the Min-Max algorithm with Alpha-Beta pruning. Diverse improvements are added incrementaly, such as the representation of a position wtih a Bitboard, the use of a Transposition Table, and the ordering of moves using an heuristic population count function.
