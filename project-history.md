# My Project History (WIP)

I've been programming since I was 10. I mostly learned how to code from online courses, before taking more advanced computer science classes.

Here is a description of most of my programming projects, from the most recent one to the oldest. The complete repositories are available on [my GitHub profile](https://github.com/Red-Rapious).

### [Digits Recognition using an MLP](https://github.com/Red-Rapious/MLP-Digits-Recognition) - July 2023

### [A multilingual Tic-Tac-Toe](https://github.com/Red-Rapious/Multilingual-Tic-Tac-Toe) - July 2023

The very first program I wrote entirely myself was a Tic-Tac-Toe that I coded in `C`, back in 2016. I still think that a Tic-Tac-Toe is a great mini-project to learn any programming language, so I decided to create this repository, with the same CLI program, written in various languages. 

### [Project Euler in Rust (problems 1-30)](https://github.com/Red-Rapious/Euler-Rust) - June 2023

Project Euler provides a set of great exercises to practice algorithmic, but I find the first problems quite good to learn a new language. Hence, I solved the first 30 problems in Rust to practice the language foundations.

### My TIPE: Car Computer Vision - 2022/2023

I worked on this machine learning project as part of my early engineering studies. The theme of the year was "The city", and I decided to implement the Viola-Jones method to detect STOP signs in images. 

### [Elements LaTeX](https://github.com/Red-Rapious/Elements-LaTeX) - July 2022

### [Navier-Stokes CFD](https://github.com/Red-Rapious/Navier-Stokes-CFD) - November & December 2021

### [Tektonik Solver 2000](https://github.com/Red-Rapious/Tektonik-Solver-2000/commits/main) - October 2021

### [Minecraft Clone using OpenGL](https://github.com/Red-Rapious/Minecraft-Clone-OpenGL) - March & April 2021

### [Rankulstone](https://github.com/Red-Rapious/Rankulstone) - January 2020

### [Project-Roguelike](https://github.com/Red-Rapious/Project-Roguelike) - July & August 2019
